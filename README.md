# Weather Checker

## Description
I assigned to create a weather checker using the OpenWeather API. I spent most of my time familiarizing myself with the docs for API set up, and how to get the extract the information I needed. While working on this project I gained experience and confidence in creating dynamically generated elements with JavaScript.

## Installation
No installs required. Works best in an updated browser.

## Usage
https://keith-l-watford.github.io/weather-checker/
Expected behavior: A user would type in their city and recieve the weather results.

Actual behavior: Nothing happens, the input and 'search' button arent properly set up. As it stands currently, you have to change the city in the JS file to get a different city's weather results
UPDATE: June 17th, 2021 - Got the search feature to work.

## Credits
Shout out to my tutor scott for helping me with the API set up and working with the docs.

## Notes
I will definitely be return to this project when I am able. All that was left was to figure out the button input and using local storage to turn previously searched cities into clickable buttons.
